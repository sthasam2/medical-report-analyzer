Pancreatic Cancer Consultation Sample Report

REFERRING PHYSICIAN: 
John Doe, MD
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
Pancreatic cancer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
The patient is a (XX)-year-old lady whom we have been following for metastatic pancreatic cancer. We saw the patient last in the office in August, and we felt that her clinical condition was deteriorating and she was not strong enough for chemotherapy. We ordered a restaging CT of the chest and abdomen and the plan was to follow up with us after the scans to make a decision about whether to continue with further systemic therapy or to be enrolled in hospice.
Over the course of the two weeks since we saw her, she went to see Dr. Jane Doe where she was placed on the macrobiotic diet and was started back on gemcitabine. She immediately developed the same skin blotchiness that she had developed previously and had progressive upper abdominal back pain and came back to the hospital for evaluation.

As an outpatient are Lipitor, Zetia, Fosamax, lisinopril, Zoloft, Xanax, vitamin B12, Os-Cal, vitamin C, Neurontin, and since she has been in the hospital, she has been started on a morphine infusion at 3 mg an hour and continues on the Duragesic patch at 75 mcg an hour that she had been on.
