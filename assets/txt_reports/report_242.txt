Exercise Stress Test Sample Report / Transcription Example

DATE OF STUDY: MM/DD/YYYY
REFERRING PHYSICIAN: John Doe, MD
REASON FOR EXAMINATION:Chest pain, shortness of breath and cardiomyopathy.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient exercised on Bruce protocol for 8 minutes and 4seconds, achieving a heart rate of 142, which is 81% of his age-predictedmaximum heart rate. Resting heart rate was 80 with resting blood pressure of 134/92.With exercise, the blood pressure increased to 169/94 and the heart rateincreased to 142. Electrocardiogram at rest revealed sinus rhythm with voltagecriteria for left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization changes. Withexercise, no significant electrocardiographic changes were noted. The patientstopped due to fatigue and shortness of breath and did not have exercise-inducedchest pain.
IMPRESSION:
1. Average exercisecapacity.
2. Somewhat bluntedheart rate response secondary to beta-blocker use.
3. Normal bloodpressure response.
4. No clinical orelectrocardiographicchanges consistent with myocardial ischemia noted duringthis exercise stress test.
5. Sestamibi imagingresults will be reported separately.

DATE OF STUDY: MM/DD/YYYY
REFERRING PHYSICIAN: John Doe, MD
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Chest pain.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Cardiolite stress testing was performed for evaluation ofchest pain. Informed consent was obtained from the patient. First, the patient had resting perfusionimages with Cardiolite. The patient wasbrought to the stress test laboratory and was exercised on regular Bruceprotocol. Resting EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, rightward axis. There was also poor R-wave progression notedover the precordial lead. The EKG wasalso of low voltage, especially in chest leads. The patient exercised onregular Bruce protocol for 4 minutes and 6 seconds. He achieved a heart rate of 126 beats perminute, which is 81% of the maximal predicted heart rate. Maximum blood pressure response was192/106. Maximum workload attained was5.5 METS. Reason for termination ofstress testing was shortness of breath, tiredness and especially legfatigue. One minute before terminationof stress testing, Cardiolite was reinjected per protocol. Review of the stressEKG and recovery EKG did not demonstrate ischemic ST depression or elevation.
CONCLUSION:
Negative exercise electrocardiogram for ischemia at aworkload of 5.5 METS.
