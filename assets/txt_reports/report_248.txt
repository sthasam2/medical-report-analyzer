Head CT scan revealed no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, extraaxial fluid collections or fracture. The visualized sinuses and the mastoid air cells were aerated. Pulmonary CT angiogram with the pulmonary embolism protocol revealed a left upper lobe mass suspicious for neoplasia. It was associated with mediastinal and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Also noted was a bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and interstitial change. Brain MRI was unremarkable. Cervical spine MRI revealed intervertebral disk degenerative changes present within the cervical spine. Maxillofacial CT in the axial plane with coronal reconstruction views revealed no acute abnormality. There was a deviated nasal septum.
LABORATORY STUDIES: The patient has a myoglobin level of 484, which is elevated. White count is 10.8, hemoglobin is 9.8, platelets are 192,000. BUN 66 and creatinine 2.8. Sodium 137 and potassium 5.4. Total bilirubin is 2.3. Urinalysis shows rbc's 206 in high power field and wbc's of 142 per high power field. Leukocyte esterase large.CT scan of the head shows a small to moderate subdural hemorrhage on the right, greatest along the tentorium but also extending laterally along the posterior temporal and parietal lobes. Chest x-ray shows possible early pneumonia adjacent to the left heart border, pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe medially. He has a urine culture, which shows Klebsiella, Enterococcus and Serratia greater than 100,000 colony-forming units.

Chemistry profile through the emergency room revealed glucose 132, BUN 37, creatinine 1.6, sodium 142, potassium 3.9, chloride 110, CO2 of 26, calcium 9.4, total protein 6.6, albumin 3.8, SGOT 36, SGPT 41, alkaline phosphatase 56, total bilirubin 1.6, magnesium 2.1. Troponin less than 0.5 x4, myoglobin 67. Cholesterol 88, triglyceride 126, HDL cholesterol 30, LDL cholesterol 33. BNP was 729. Hemoglobin A1c was 5.9. Urinalysis was within normal limits. Stool for occult blood was negative.Myocardial perfusion imaging with Cardiolite revealed irreversible perfusion defect in the inferior wall, presumably due to underlying infarct. The left ventricle was markedly dilated. Ejection fraction of the left ventricle was 25%. Portable chest x-ray at the time of admission revealed bilateral infiltrates and mild vascular congestion, most likely representing congestive heart failure. EKG revealed an electronic ventricular pacemaker with premature ventricular complexes. When compared with a previous EKG, ventricular rate had decreased by 18 beats per minute. There was limited echocardiographic study and Optison was used to improve endocardial visualization. Mild left atrial enlargement with normal right atrial size. Mild left ventricular chamber enlargement with decreased left ventricular contractility. Estimated ejection fraction was in the 40% range. There was global hypokinesia; however, the inferior wall did appear more hypokinetic than the remainder of the ventricle, as does the posterior wall. There was a small pleural effusion. Normal aortic root dimension. Mild thickening of the mitral valve with normal opening and closure. Mild thickening of the aortic valve with normal opening and closure. Normal appearance of the tricuspid valve. Doppler exam showed mild tricuspid regurgitation with no tricuspid stenosis. There was moderate pulmonary hypertension and estimated pulmonary pressures of approximately 50 to 55. Normal function of the aortic valve with no regurgitation or stenosis. Normal function of the pulmonic valve. Trace mitral regurgitation with no mitral stenosis.
