Renal Consult Medical Transcription Transcribed Sample Report

DATE OF CONSULTATION: MM/DD/YYYY
CONSULTING PHYSICIAN: John Doe, MD
REQUESTING PHYSICIAN: Jane Doe, MD
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: To evaluate the patient for acute renal failure.
SOURCE AND RELIABILITY: History obtained from medical records. Unable to obtain history from the patient because he is intubated.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a (XX)-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, history of bypass surgery, chronic anemia with 3-month history of shortness of breath with exertion. The patient denied associated chest pain. He had worsening symptoms over the past week prior to admission. He underwent an outpatient dobutamine stress test. This was negative for reversible ischemia. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 35% and heart rhythm was irregular. The patient was admitted for further cardiac workup of atrial fibrillation. He was in congestive heart failure and required IV diuretics. BUN and creatinine on admission was 8.5 and 0.8 and H and H was 8.8 and 27.4. The patient underwent EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation of chronic anemia. EGD showed multiple antral erosions with chronic gastritis and colonoscopy revealed an ascending colon mass, 75% occlusion. Pathology is positive for moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient also had problems with bradyarrhythmias, which required pacemaker placement. He developed a brief episode of acute encephalopathy, which resolved on its own. EEG did not show any seizures. The patient was being optimized for right colectomy. He is having problems with elevated LFTs and coagulopathy, which is being corrected with FFP. Yesterday, the patient developed acute onset of shortness of breath requiring intubation. He became hypotensive post medications. The patient developed acute renal failure with baseline creatinine of 0.8, yesterday 1.8. Today, creatinine is 2.8. Therefore, renal consult has been obtained. The patient did receive boluses of IV fluids, and despite that, urine output has been marginal. Lasix drip was started overnight with no improvement today. The patient is anuric. He is currently on norepinephrine drip. The patient does not have any evidence of prior kidney disease. CT scan of the abdomen with IV contrast was performed and this revealed nonobstructive, right-sided renal stones.

Chest x-ray performed today and reviewed by me showed cardiomegaly with right upper chest wall pacemaker. Pulmonary edema is present with increasing right pleural effusion. Chest x-ray is worse compared to the prior x-ray. Also, right lower infiltrate present. Echocardiogram performed during his hospitalization showed ejection fraction of 40% to 45% with mid inferoseptal, apical septal and apical anterior wall hypokinesis. Right atrial and left atrial enlargement mild to moderate. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. EKG reviewed by me showed PR interval 166 milliseconds, QTc 384 milliseconds. Q-waves in inferior leads, poor R-wave progression. Inferolateral T-wave inversions. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast showed fatty infiltration of liver and no evidence of metastatic disease. Right renal stones, 5 mm, nonobstructing calculus in upper pole of right kidney and second calculus in lower pole. Cardiomegaly and tiny right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute renal failure. This is due to prerenal sepsis, congestive heart failure in a patient newly diagnosed with right colon carcinoma. Renal function is worsening despite challenges with IV fluids. The patient remains anuric despite Lasix drip. The patient will need continuous hemodialysis. No evidence of obstruction. The patient is currently on broad spectrum antibiotics. The patient did receive IV contrast during this hospitalization; however, his creatinine remained stable. It is unlikely to be the primary cause of his current acute renal failure.
2. Renal stone which is nonobstructive. This can be worked up as an outpatient when the patient stabilizes.
3. Right colon carcinoma. The patient needs a colectomy once he is medically stable.
4. Coronary artery disease with cardiomyopathy and new onset of atrial fibrillation.
5. Elevated LFTs. This may be due to congestive heart failure and this is improving. We will rule out hepatitis.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. We will initiate continuous hemodialysis today and remove fluid. Consent has been obtained over the phone from the patient's durable power of attorney, who is his son.
2. We will check hepatitis B and C serologies.
3. Continue IV antibiotics.
4. Discontinue Celebrex.
We will follow along closely with you. Thank you for this referral.
