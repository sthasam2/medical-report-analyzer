I prescribed Allegra D 24 hours 1 p.o. daily p.r.n. and Patanol drops 1 each eye b.i.d. p.r.n. I also gave her a prescription for albuterol 2 inhalations q.i.d. p.r.n. wheezing and tightness in her chest. I told her that if she started to use this regularly, more than once or twice a day, she is to call me.
I plan to see her in June for followup evaluation of her regular allergies. I plan to bring her in earlier for local anesthetic testing.
