PLAN: The patient presents with the above-mentioned problems. Symptomatic treatment is being given with pain management. IV fluids are being given. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis are pending. After that, I will determine further management. I will continue to follow her and I will assess the need of colonoscopy after the CT scan result.
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this patientâ€™s care.
