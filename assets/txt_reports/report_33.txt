The patient's sodium was 135, potassium 3.8, chloride 100, carbon dioxide 28, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, glucose 120, calcium 8.6. Magnesium level pending. Total bilirubin 12.8, was 14.2 on admission, peaking at 15.8 two days after ERCP. Direct bilirubin 7.3, down from 8.6 on admission. Indirect bilirubin 5.4, down from peak of 6.8 after ERCP. AST 41, down from 142 on admission. ALT 48, down from 204 on admission. Total protein 4.6, albumin 2.2, alkaline phosphatase 274, down from 360 on admission. Amylase 34, lipase 22. CA 19-9 antigen 534, which was markedly elevated. The patient's sodium on admission was 131. PT 13.6, INR 1.1, PTT 24. D-dimer 0.74. The patient's urine was amber in appearance, 25 mg estimated protein, large amount of bilirubin, negative leukocyte esterase, 2-4 white cells, 10-14 granular casts, and 3-4 white cell casts.
LABORATORY DATA: WBC 6.6, hemoglobin 11.6, hematocrit at 32.8, MCV 86.6, and platelet count 109,000. PT 11.2. INR 1.0.

LABORATORY DATA: Includes a white count of 10.6, hemoglobin 12.4, hematocrit 37.2, and a platelet count 190,000. Chemistries include a sodium 134, potassium 4.2, chloride 104, CO2 of 28. BUN 78 and creatinine 3.6; the initial creatinine was 4.2. Glucose 176. CPK 2024 today and it was 1880 yesterday with MB of 1.3 and a troponin of less than 0.06 and a troponin yesterday 0.6. The CPK from his prior admission was reportedly 312. Protime 11.2, INR 1.0, and PTT 24. Arterial blood gas shows a pH 7.38, PCO2 of 44, and a PO2 of 46 with an oxygen saturation of 79. It is unclear whether that was a venous stick as it does not seem to correlate with his clinical status. The patient had a CAT scan of the brain, which showed chronic periventricular ischemic white matter changes with no acute abnormalities seen. The chest x-ray from his prior admission showed no evidence of congestive heart failure and again today it shows no congestive heart failure, but evidence of cardiomegaly with a pacemaker defibrillator noted. A lung scan was done on the prior admission for similar problems and was low probability for pulmonary emboli.
LABORATORY STUDIES: Still pending are anti-Sjogren's antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic Ab, anti-single-stranded DNA Ab, anti-double-stranded DNA Ab, angiotensin converting enzyme, rheumatoid factor, Lyme titer, ANA. RPR nonreactive. Rheumatoid factor negative. WBC 8.8, hemoglobin 14.2, hematocrit 42.4, and platelets 234,000. ESR 5. Sodium 141, potassium 3.6, chloride 110, carbon dioxide 26, BUN 16, creatinine 1.1, glucose 88, calcium 9.4. Liver function tests within normal limits. Vitamin B12 of 440, folate 15.6. TSH 0.68.
