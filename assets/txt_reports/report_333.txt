B-type natriuretic peptide was 426. CK-MB and troponins were negative. Urine; trace albumin, trace leukocyte esterase. Stool for occult blood was negative. Cultures on the chart negative.
Venous Doppler of the lower extremities revealed no evidence of DVT. Echocardiogram: Mild to moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal leaflet size and function with normal systolic function, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, however, and trace mitral regurgitation. EKG: Sinus rhythm, low voltage. The patient underwent fine needle aspiration with guidance with successful ultrasound-guided drainage, loculated small pocket of fluid adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall, represented purulent material. Ultrasound of the gallbladder: Pancreas is not enlarged. It has heterogeneous echotexture, nonspecific. Exophytic cyst along the right lobe of the liver was seen on prior CT. No evidence of gallstone or definite right renal stone. Minimal right perirenal fluid and a small fluid collection in the right mid abdomen measuring 4.4 x 4.6 x 1.4. CT of the abdomen limited with small fluid accumulation in the right mid abdomen measuring 1.4 x 2.6, probable liver cyst. Also, possible partial small bowel obstruction, distal ileum, and there is some fecal material in the colon. CT pelvis: Low-grade partial small bowel obstruction.
DIAGNOSTIC DATA: CT of pelvis was performed revealing status post prostatectomy, diffuse metastatic disease to bone, large amount of fecal material in the rectosigmoid, and nodular contour to the posterior wall of the bladder, not significantly changed from prior. Postsurgical CT abdomen revealed approximately a 2.3 cm soft tissue mass just posterior to the left common iliac vein suspicious for metastatic lesion, low attenuation lesion measuring 1.4 cm of parapelvic region of left kidney, most likely representing cyst, atrophy of the right kidney, diffuse metastatic disease to bone and CT appearance of an acute pathologic fracture involving L1 vertebral body. CT of brain was negative for acute hemorrhage or mass effects and small vessel ischemic changes as well as lacunar infarct, right basal ganglia and internal capsule. Negative for acute hemorrhage or mass effect. CT of chest revealed enlarged lymph nodes within the mediastinum with the take-off of the left subclavian artery measuring up to 2.5 cm in size suspicious for metastatic disease. Incidentally noted but not mentioned in the findings of the report. There was 1.7 cm soft tissue lesion within the left subclavicular fossa, multiple nodular infiltrates throughout the right upper lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe. Differential diagnosis would include infectious etiology versus diffuse osseous metastatic disease. CT of chest was performed to rule out pulmonary embolus as the patient had atypical chest pain during the course of hospitalization. There was no PE or multiple osseous lesions. Stable mediastinal adenopathy and nodular infiltrates persist within the right upper and lower lobes. X-ray of spine revealed diffuse bony sclerotic metastasis, wedge compression deformity of L1, L3-L4, and L4-L5 degenerative disk disease, also facet degenerative disease on the left at L3 to S1.

EKG showed sinus arrhythmia at 96 to 142 with left axis deviation. Abdominal x-ray showed diffuse bowel gas pattern. Chest x-ray showed some perihilar questionable congestion. He had a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The CAT scan was consistent with diverticulitis involving the distal descending colon with localized perforation and extraluminal air adjacent to part of the colon consistent with localized perforation of the descending colon.
