3. Reactive leukocytosis
4. Reactive hyperferritinemia.
The patient is a (XX)-year-old female who was seen in consultation for progressive leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and hyperferritinemia. Following an outpatient consultation, she was subjected to lab tests and a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. At the time of her consultation, she had also complained of a 30-pound weight loss over the last one year. Her lab tests that included leukocyte alkaline phosphatase and methylmalonic acid level noted an elevated methylmalonic acid consistent with B12 deficiency. Her leukocyte alkaline phosphatase was also elevated suggesting a reactive leukocytosis rather than a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. She then underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and was noted to have a normal cellular marrow showing normal maturation of myeloid precursors. Rare hypersegmented neutrophils and rare dyserythropoietic cells were also identified. Megakaryocytes appeared increased in numbers, and the blast count was less than 2%. There was no evidence of reticulin fibrosis, and the bone marrow biopsy findings were not suggestive of a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. Incidentally, a flow cytometry that was done on the bone marrow aspirate noted a small monoclonal B-cell population with chronic lymphocytic leukemic phenotype versus a small lymphocytic lymphoma phenotype with lambda light chain restriction. B cells accounted for less than 3% of the total cells analyzed. Based on this evaluation, she has been diagnosed with B12 deficiency and a low-grade lymphoma. Her leukocytosis is secondary to a reactive process rather than a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. Her hyperferritinemia was further investigated with a hemochromatosis gene analysis. This gene analysis was negative for a hereditary hemochromatosis.
PLAN:
1. Vitamin B 12 one mg intramuscular every month.
2. Folic acid 1 mg by mouth every day.
3. Antiparietal cell antibodies.
4. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.
5. CAT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to further evaluate her lymphoma.
6. No intervention required for her leukocytosis.
7. Consider upper endoscopy in light of severe dyspepsia.
8. Awaiting Philadelphia chromosome analysis.
9. Consider screening upper endoscopy if the patient has pernicious anemia.
Thank you, Dr. Doe, for this interesting consult. We will follow the patient with you.Medical Transcription SamplesMedical Transcription Word Seeker - Google Custom Search for MTs - Searches just Medical Websites
