Left Ring Trigger Finger Release Medical Transcription Operative Sample

OPERATION IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating  room and laid supine on the operating room table. Ten mL of a mixture of  Marcaine and lidocaine was injected at the level of the distal flexion crease in  line with the ring finger. Next, a tourniquet was placed on his left forearm.  The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. An  Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the left upper extremity, and the  tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. Next, a transverse incision approximately 2  cm in length was made just distal to the distal flexion crease, in the palm, in  line with the ring finger. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous  fat down to the level of the tendon sheath. The A1 pulley was identified and  incised with a 15 blade. After incision of the A1 pulley, the finger was taken  through a full range of motion. No further triggering was noted. There was no  further locking. The patient was asked to actively flex and extend his fingers,  and he did not note any catching or locking. The wound was then thoroughly  irrigated with normal saline. The tourniquet was deflated. The skin was closed  with 5-0 nylon suture in horizontal mattress fashion. Sterile dressings were  applied. The patient was then transferred back onto a stretcher and taken to  Same Day Surgery.
