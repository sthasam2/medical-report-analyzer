Normoactive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: There is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. NEUROLOGICAL: He is lethargic, follows a few simple commands, and moves all four extremities.

CHEST: Moves symmetrically with inspiration and expiration with good air entry, occasional crackles at the bases. CARDIAC: S1 and S2 noted. ABDOMEN: Soft, tympanic, distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive. NEUROLOGICAL: Neurologically, the patient is alert. EXTREMITIES: Without any calf tenderness.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a comfortable-appearing female. SKIN: Warm and dry. HEENT: Head normocephalic. Eyes, extraocular movements intact. Ears are clear. Nose is clear. Throat is clear. NECK: Supple. Trachea is midline. No lymphadenopathy. CHEST: Symmetrical. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2. No adventitious sound appreciated. LUNGS: Clear with equal air entry bilaterally. No rales. No rhonchi. ABDOMEN: Obese, soft, and nontender. No masses on palpation. Positive bowel sounds. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Normal range of motion. EXTREMITIES: Warm. Pulses 2+. No edema appreciated. NEUROLOGICAL: Awake and oriented x3. No focal neurological deficits appreciated.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Stable. Temperature is 99.6 degrees. EXTREMITIES: The patient states he has pain in his lower extremity extending from his knee down into his ankle and foot. Nails are thick and elongated with subungual and superficial debris, 1 through 5 bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Sharp/dull, light touch, proprioception are all diminished. Muscle power is +3/5, dorsiflexor and plantar flexor, to inversion and eversion. SKIN: Peeling and dry throughout the lower extremity extending down into the toes with slight maceration.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: On examination, the patient is a weak, ill-appearing male who looks older than his stated age. Vital Signs: His blood pressure is normal. He is afebrile. His urine output has been recorded as about 150 mL yesterday for an intake of about 330 mL. HEENT: He has a large, irregular ulcer on the left cheek. There appears to be no obvious signs of infection. Neck: He has positive jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits. Lungs: Diminished breath sounds on the right hemithorax.
