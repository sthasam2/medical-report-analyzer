Colonoscopy with Snare Polypectomy Example Report

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained after explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure. The patient was premedicated to achieve conscious sedation. Rectal examination revealed small external hemorrhoids. The video colonoscope was inserted in the rectum and gently advanced to the cecum under direct visualization with some minimal difficulty due to looping and redundant colon. The cecum was intubated and identified by the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve. The cecum was normal as was the ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure and descending colon. Overall, the preparation was good.

The rectum had small-to-moderate sized internal hemorrhoids seen on frontal and retroflexion view. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.
