MRI OF THE RIGHT KNEE TRANSCRIPTION SAMPLE

MRI OF THE RIGHT KNEE TRANSCRIPTION SAMPLEMultiplanar images were obtained. The ACL and PCL are both intact. The collateral ligaments are intact. The menisci are within normal limits. There is no meniscal tear. The patella is abnormally low in position consistent with a patella baja. This may be seen in association with Osgood-Schlatter disease, which is traumatic disturbance of the tibial tuberosity. This may also be appreciated. Patella baja may be seen post surgery. There is no evidence of Osgood-Schlatter disease. There is no irregularity of the tibial tuberosity. There is some retropatellar fluid as well as fluid anterior and lateral to the ACL. The marrow signal within the bony structures is unremarkable. There is some very minimal increased signal in the patellar tendon on the T1 weighted sequences. While some of this may be partial volume averaging, some patellar tendon degeneration is also a consideration. This could be due to injury in this area.IMPRESSION:1. There is an abnormally low position of the patella consistent with patella baja. This may be seen in association with Osgood-Schlatter disease or patellar realignment surgeries. The patient has not had surgery. There is no evidence of Osgood-Schlatter disease on the MRI today.2. There is some subtle increased signal in the patellar tendon on T1 weighted sequences for which some patellar tendon degeneration is not excluded. This may be due to some trauma in this area.3. Menisci, collateral ligaments, cruciate ligaments are all unremarkable.Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest
