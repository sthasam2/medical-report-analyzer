MRI OF THE BRAIN AND ORBITS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST

Multiplanar images were obtained. Coronal FLAIR images were included as well.
MRI OF THE BRAIN:
The craniocervical junction is within normal limits. There is no mass, mass effect, or shift of midline structures. The ventricles are symmetric. On the FLAIR sequences, there is no abnormal area of increased signal within the brain parenchyma. In particular, there are no abnormal areas of increased signal in the periventricular white matter to suggest MS. The IACs are symmetric and unremarkable. With contrast, there is no abnormal enhancing lesion.
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable noncontrast and contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain.
MRI OF THE ORBITS:
Multiplanar images were obtained without and with contrast. The optic nerves are symmetric and unremarkable. There is no enhancement following contrast administration. The recti muscles are also symmetric. There is no intraorbital mass or abnormality adjacent to the globe. The pituitary gland is also unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric and unremarkable optic nerves. There is no abnormal area of increased signal within the optic nerves on the FLAIR sequences.Medical Transcription Samples  More MRI Sample Reports and ExamplesMedical Transcription Word Seeker - Google Custom Search for MTs - Searches just Medical Websites
