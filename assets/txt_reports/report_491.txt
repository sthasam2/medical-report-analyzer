Lungs: Clear to auscultation.
Heart: Regular rhythm and rate. No murmurs or gallops. Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetrical.
Abdomen: Benign. Active bowel sounds. No tenderness on deep palpation noted.
Extremities: All extremities are normal in alignment. Good plantar surfaces for weightbearing purposes. The left knee has 1+ effusion as well as left lower leg 1+ edema.

REHABILITATION POTENTIAL: Good to achieve home discharge at modified independent/independent level.
REHABILITATION ELOS: Anticipated 5 to 7 days to accomplish ambulation more than 200 feet with assistive devices, transfers and self-care skills at modified independent/independent level with knee flexion at 90 degrees.
REHABILITATION ASSESSMENT:
1. Status post left total knee replacement complicated with a previous history of right knee arthroscopy and anterior cruciate ligament repair.
2. History of hypertension.
3. Osteoarthritis.
PLAN AND SUMMARY: This is a (XX)-year-old male who is a good rehabilitation candidate to achieve home discharge in 5 to 7 days at a modified independent/independent level. It is anticipated that the patient would benefit from following physical therapy, occupational therapy, increased strength, overall function, and develop home exercise program. Nursing will continue with wound care and monitor vital signs. Care management will assist with discharge planning. Rehabilitation physicians will maintain optimal medical status as well as coordinate discharge planning and followup care as needed.
