There is no old EKG for comparison. Noncontrast head CT was unremarkable. Chest x-ray was unremarkable. Sodium 138, potassium 3.8, BUN and creatinine 17 and 1.2 respectively with a glucose of 86. White count 6.6 with an H and H of 14.6 and 43.8, platelets 246,000. Cardiac enzymes are negative and normal x2. An LP was performed. CSF findings came back consistent with viral meningitis with a glucose of 54 and protein of 44, which were both within normal limits. Tube 1: Somewhat of a traumatic tap with 3000 red blood cells, 104 whites with 87 lymphocytes and 12% monocytes. Tube 4: Showed 3 red blood cells, still 100 white blood cells with 82% lymphocytes, 16% monocytes, and 1% eosinophil. Given this pattern, this is most likely viral meningitis.

EKG was done, which showed a normal sinus rhythm, heart rate is 66. No ST elevation or depression noted. No acute ischemic changes noted, normal axis. There is no old EKG to compare to at this time. Also did a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which did show gallstones and acute cholecystitis.

A chest x-ray showed mild hyperinflation; otherwise, no acute disease. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm, heart rate of 74 with no ST elevation or depression noted. No acute ischemic changes were noted.
LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA: CBC: White count 11.6, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.6, platelets 344. Renal panel showed sodium of 140, potassium 5.1, chloride 111, BUN 46, creatinine 1.9, which is up from her baseline of 1.2. She had a glucose of 120. Cardiac enzymes showed a CK-MB of 9.2 and a troponin of less than 0.05. She did have a total CK of 882. The patient had a BNP, which was 260 and protime and INR which were within normal limits. She had a chest x-ray which showed AICD, otherwise no acute process. She had an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 106, normal axis, normal intervals. She did have Q-waves in the inferior leads indicating an old MI. She also had LVH. She also had T waves in leads V4 through V6. There was no ST elevation or depression, no evidence of any acute ischemia.
LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA: CBC: White count 12.2, hemoglobin 11.4, hematocrit 33.6, platelets were 228. Initial renal panel showed sodium of 131, potassium 3.2, chloride 102, BUN 32, creatinine 1.3. Glucose was 98. She had LFTs and lipase, which were within normal limits. Urinalysis showed 30 protein and was otherwise negative. She was typed and screened, which showed A positive with a negative antibody screen. She had acute abdominal series, which showed indeterminate for small bowel obstruction. Repeat renal panel showed a BUN of 28 and creatinine of 1.1. Her potassium also improved to 3.6. The patient did have a CT of abdomen and pelvis with IV and p.o. contrast with no acute abnormalities noted. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 88. She had a left bundle branch block, normal intervals. She did have one set of cardiac enzymes, which were negative.
